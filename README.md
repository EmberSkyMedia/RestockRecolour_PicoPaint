# HOWTO INSTALL
Download source, grab inside TU_Restock(without license or readme, 3 folders and 4 txts), and put into GameData(no no TURD!)

# Honorable Mentions:
* @UncleMateo and @Spartwo for contribution
* OrbitalPhoenix, for inspiring to do the same thing, and ~~stolen~~ inspired mk1-3pod design
* ZZetho for creating amazing tutorial
* And of course TURD, TU and Restock
* (pss, and my config maker too, very handy)

# Parts Done:

### 73/320

** MOVED TO [WIKI](https://github.com/likeproblem/RestockRecolour/wiki/Part-List) **

# Known Issues:
* Shielded docking port: meshes were named the same, so the door looks ugly, sorry
* Some stuff doesn't like switching meshes properly, for now only engine plate's connect points, so after you switch it you have to switch to Squad and Bob Ross Paints again
* Engine plate does't work with boattail for some reason, though it looks fine in VAB, it resets when you launch :/

# Contribution!

# TODO
* Proper wiki for contributing, explain TURD_ConfigMaker, video too
* Fix shielded docking port
* Tidy up configs for proper organization - **TECHNICALLY DONE, BUT PLEASE FOLLOW CATEGORIES AND MAKE SURE PARTS ARE IN SAME ORDER IN BOTH FILES**
* Better cupola??
* Proper testing for all new parts
