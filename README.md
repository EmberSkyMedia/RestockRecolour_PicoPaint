# HOWTO INSTALL
Download source, grab inside TU_Restock(without license or readme, 3 folders and 4 txts), and put into GameData(no no TURD!)

# Honorable Mentions:
* OrbitalPhoenix, for inspiring to do the same thing, and ~~stolen~~ inspired mk1-3pod design
* ZZetho for creating amazing tutorial
* And of course TURD, TU and Restock
* (pss, and my config maker too, very handy)

# Parts Done:

### 20/318

** MOVED TO [WIKI](https://github.com/likeproblem/RestockRecolour/wiki/Part-List)

# Known Issues:
* Shielded docking port: meshes were named the same, so the door looks ugly, sorry
* Some stuff doesn't like switching meshes properly, for now only engine plate's connect points, so after you switch it you have to switch to Squad and Bob Ross Paints again
