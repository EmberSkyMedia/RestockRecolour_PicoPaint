Shortly, config has VARIABLE;PROMPT;DEFAULT_VALUE structure, variable name(without $$), prompt which asks, and default value if user inputs nothing

Also autodefault has values which will, well, default automatically without prompt, useful for variables you dont use often, like MOD

paths.txt provides great customization over path files AND their names

After you answer all prompts, it will ask for init or add or meshify(about that later). IF YOU DIDN'T CREATE FILES MANUALLY OR WITH INIT USE INIT FIRST. Then you can add parts with ease using add.

Also it will ask "meshes", you just first answer mesh YOU WANT TO COLOR, if multiple use ; same with exclude mesh, obtainable from ModelData as usual

After you answer the exclude meshes, you may want to use meshify option when you restart, it will do same stuff but only adds +TEXTURE_SET without @PART, though I never used it much
